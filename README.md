# Truefactor Web Client

This is an experimental client that implements Truefactor Protocol. It is not supposed to be used by general public. Everyone should use a native client instead.

It does not use shiny frontend frameworks as we need as less dependencies as possible. Currently it depends on TweetNaCl.js, Scrypt.js/Scrypt-async-js (Web/Native accordingly) and QR generate/scan library for Offline Mode.
